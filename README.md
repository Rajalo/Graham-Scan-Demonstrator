# Graham Scan Demonstrator

This program shows how the Graham Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points works. 
It has 4 stages, the DRAWING stage, the SORTING stage, the SCANNING stage, and the FINAL stage.

In the DRAWING stage, users left-click to add in points, right-click to remove the closest point to the cursor

In the SORTING stage, the program sorts the inputted points by the angle they form with the lowest point.

In the SCANNING stage, the user clicks through to see the different steps as the Graham scan processes the points in order.

In the FINAL stage, the program shows the convex hull generated by the scan.
